Building BetterTTV
===

Getting the essentials
---
1. Install nodejs.
2. Run ```npm install``` within the BetterTTV directory.

Gulp
---
We use gulp to concatenate all of the files and templates into one. You can either make gulp watch for changes or run it manually.

From the BetterTTV directory, run
```
gulp
```
or
```
gulp watch
```

Testing
----

We include a test module that creates a server to imitate the CDN.

To use it, we must first modify the hosts file on your computer.

**on *nix:**
```
echo "127.0.0.1 cdn.betterttv.net" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**on Windows:**

add ```127.0.0.1 cdn.betterttv.net``` to ```%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts```

Now just run the following command from the BetterTTV directory.

**on *nix:**
```
sudo npm test
```

**on Windows you need an elevated command prompt:**
```
npm test
```

A webserver will start and you can visit Twitch in your browser and browse normally. Files not included in the repo are pulled from the actual server, so everything works.

**Debug Messages:**

In order to receive debug messages inside the browser's console log, you must toggle the consoleLog localStorage setting.

Type this in the JavaScript console to enable console logging:
```
BetterTTV.settings.save('consoleLog', true);
```
